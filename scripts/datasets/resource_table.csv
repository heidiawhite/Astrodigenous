Many limitations presented by traditional cartography, however, have been overcome by new mapping and documenting techniques and technologies. While traditional paper maps could only render geographic location and spelling of an orally transmitted place name, new technologies allow for the recording and presentation of the stories and other information connected to the name. The Cybercartographic approach goes a step further, creating a digital environment for data integration. The Gwich'in Cybercartographic Atlas can be understood as a framework within which the user is able to build his/her own narrative through the seamless use and connection of different datasets. This paper discusses the potential and limitations of this approach in the documenting of oral spatial and environmental narratives""",English,Y,2014

This article uses the methodology of “comparative ethnoastronomy” to explore the story of “The Boy in the Moon” and its place in Gwich’in culture to inform on a Babylonian tradition of a Lion Man in the Moon. The study makes use of a wide variety of documentary evidence ranging in time from millenniaold cuneiform tablets from Babylonia to modern works on the anthropology of the Gwich’in and interviews with tribal elders, and it concludes with some thoughts on the shared human experience of looking at the sky.""",English,Y,2018
